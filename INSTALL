These are the the instructions for installing u2-mode for GNU Emacs.

This is still very immature. Very.  For now, just copy the files
somewhere, put that somewhere in your Emacs load-pat with

(push "/some/where" load-path)

and

(load-file "/some/where/u2-load.el").


Then you should be able to just `M-x unidata', and it will prompt you
for the path name.  The path name can be a remote path.  For example,
to log in to the Unidata account in `/data/unidata/accountX' on the
remote server unimonster as user `someone', enter the following at the
unidata prompt:

/[telnet:]someone@unimonster:/data/unidata/accountX

and hit Enter.  The [telnet:] is optional, but if tramp is loaded, it
will tell tramp how to list files when you `View Account in Dired', an
option available on the menu (C-RightClick).
