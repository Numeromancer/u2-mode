;;; Commentary:

;; An implementation of file information caching for remote files.

;; Each connection (method, user, host) has a unique cache.
;; Each file has a unique set of properties associated with it.
;; Although method doesn't seem to be necessary, it allows a simpler
;; implementation.  And it doesn't matter, because it is rather rare a
;; remote host will be accessed using different methods in parallel.

;;; Code:

;; Maybe the code could be rearranged to avoid completely (method, user, host).
;; This would require that all functions are called from the connection buffer
;; only; something which could be forgotten.  And I have no idea whether
;; this is really a performance boost.

;; Another performance speedup could be the use of 'eq instead of 'equal for
;; the hash test function.  But this case the key, being a string, would need
;; to be transformed into a unique symbol, which would eat all saved time.

;; ;; Pacify byte-compiler.
