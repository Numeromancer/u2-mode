# u2-mode
Emacs u2-mode moved from sourceforge

I was forced at one point to work with the Pick database implementation
know as U2. In order to make this palatable, I used my situation as an
excuse to do some lisp programming, by setting up a development environment
for using U2 from emacs. This is the result. It is very incomplete, and I
haven't touched it in a long time. It may not even work with the current 
version of Emacs. At most this could serve as a starting point for someone 
else to complete the work.

Maybe someday someone else will find it useful.
